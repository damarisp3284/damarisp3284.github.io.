            <h1 class="margin text-center">Example Project</h1>
            <p> Using our skills from HTML and CSS I have partnered up with a classmate, Ronnie Huang, into making a movie webpage called Grim Trick.</p>
            <p> Context: Ronnie was inspired by Halloween related theme movie for our webpage and I thought it was a great idea since it wasn't long that it was halloween, as well as trying to give a horror related theme. 
              Our main character, Elias, is out in a halloween night for trick or treating with his friends in their neighbourhood, as they collect candy Elias starts to get notifications in his phone but as these notifications appeared his friends spotted a creepy looking like mansion in which they wanted to enter for "fun". 
              Elias took a quick glance at his phone, then the house, remembering the rumours about this dark place that is filled with mystery due to the previous owners disapearing. Hesitaiting he was willing to enter into the unknown.

            Some challenges we have faced was trying to figure out how to make a unique background since it involved alot of RGB numbers, as well as input because we didn't really know how it would fit into our movie but once we figured out using 
                a website called W3Schools, seeing the examples we saw how inputs worked and the different kinds to use. We also mixed up the fonts and sometimes when adding the fonts into our html code we didn't get our paragraphs changed that's unitl I noticed that we were missing the semicolon so me and Ronnie doubled checked to make sure if we made mistakes and go back to correct them.

                Reflection: This movie really reflected on our skills with HTML and CSS because although we knew most of the basics, still there was errors in which we carelessly made. All our creativity was put into the movie in which I had alot of fun making it especially with CSS because we made it all colorful and not boring. What I noticed from myself is I need to used more properties such as margins, and anything border related, but I am proud that we have used HTML properties like, divs, SPANs, paragraphs, headings, fonts, class and id.
                Reflecting on what I need to improve, for future website development and projects that we may have. So I could be prepared for more advanced things.
