            <h1 class="margin text-center">Example Project</h1>
            <p> My partner Alaa and I decided to create a project called escaping granny</p>
            <p> Our Teacher let us build our own CYOA project in which we had to decided a topic we wanted to choose to build our project. 
                My partner Alaa thought something escaping related would be good while I though more of like a spooky or haunted place so we decided to combine those ideas into our project.
                 The character in our project is in a haunted house locked up in a room in which they find a note that said "Are you ready to escape?  Start with the key"
                I had to do the final scene of my project was when the character is about to escape out of the haunted house, still finding notes that helped guide and gave hints to then the character must figure out what to find to escape.
            
            A challenge we faced was merging conflicts because as we both made changes into parts of our story we had issues like when our code wasn't ready to be committed or their wasn't anything to be pulled into github.
            We both didn't know what to do until I tried searching for a command that would help in W3Schools or searching it up online, in which I found in a user from cs50.dev had the same issue as us but a comment recommended that he used git add -A followed by git commit "update". 
            Using this helped me commit and push my changes on github.
            
                
                Reflection: Overall, it was another challenge to build this project as we did most of the coding from cs50.dev and then pushing all of that code to our github directory but I liked how this challenged our knowledge of CLI and github skills. 
                I will try to use more of the command touch instead of mkdir to avoid getting confused when creating either directories or files.
